The Proxy pattern provides several key benefits:
Types of Proxies Shown:

Smart Proxy (DatabaseServiceProxy) - Adds caching, lazy initialization, and security checks
Virtual Proxy (VirtualProxy) - Delays expensive object creation until actually needed
Protection Proxy (ProtectionProxy) - Controls access based on permissions

Key Features:

Lazy Loading: Real objects are created only when needed
Caching: Frequently accessed data is cached for performance
Security: Malicious operations are blocked before reaching the real object
Access Control: Different user roles have different permissions
Resource Management: Proper cleanup and connection handling

When to Use:

Control access to expensive resources
Add security layers
Implement caching mechanisms
Provide lazy initialization
Add logging, monitoring, or validation

The proxy maintains the same interface as the real object, making it transparent to clients while adding valuable functionality like performance optimization and security controls.
